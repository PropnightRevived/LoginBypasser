# Login Bypasser
This [UE4SS](https://github.com/UE4SS-RE/RE-UE4SS) mod allows you to bypass non working Steam verification
and matchmaking initialization because domains of services that were responsible for that no longer work

# Using mod
While you are on the "Press Any Key" screen press `Ctrl + Space`

# Installing
1. Download code from this repository
2. Create folder `PropnightLoginBypasser` in folder `Mods` of your UE4SS installation
3. Unpack downloaded archive to newly created folder
4. Add line `PropnightLoginBypasser : 1` to file `mods.txt` in the same folder `Mods` as in step 2

# Possible issues
From time to time Unreal Engine can give you fatal error that will close game. The only solution is to restart game and try again.
