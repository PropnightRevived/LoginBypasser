# Login Bypasser
This [UE4SS](https://github.com/UE4SS-RE/RE-UE4SS) mod allows you to bypass non working Steam verification
and matchmaking initialization because domains of services that were responsible for that no longer work

# Using mod
While you are on the "Press Any Key" screen press `Ctrl + Space`

# Installing
1. Download code from this repository
2. Create folder `PropnightLoginBypasser` in folder `Mods` of your UE4SS installation
3. Unpack content of folder `LoginBypasser-main` from downloaded archive to newly created folder
4. Add line `PropnightLoginBypasser : 1` to file `mods.txt` in the same folder `Mods` as in step 2

# Possible issues
From time to time Unreal Engine can give you fatal error that will close game. Make sure Steam is launched, you have Propnight in library and game is using Propnight's App ID, then restart game and try again.
